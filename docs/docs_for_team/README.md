## Provisioning of the Jenkins

Documentation is in [the main README of the repo](https://github.com/alphagov/re-build-systems-dns).

## How to set up a job using Jenkinsfile

This is an [example of a project](https://github.com/alphagov/re-build-systems-sample-java-app/tree/jenkinsfile-supported-by-re-build-mvp) that can be built using this Jenkins platform.

It shows how to structure the Jenkinsfile - the most important part is this:

```
agent {
    label 'docker-jnlp-java-agent'
}
```

Your docker image can be defined using the [template file](https://github.com/alphagov/re-build-systems/blob/master/docker/files/groovy/add-sample-agent-docker-image.groovy).
Please make a copy of that file and edit it to your own specification. There are four variables that need adjusting;

* image - The hash or tagged name of the image that you wish docker to run
* labelString - Must match the agent:label in the Jenkinsfile of your app
* name - Name of this Docker Cloud
* serverUrl - URI to the Docker Host you are using.

These are all labelled 'custom' within the template file.

For extra guidance on using Jenkins' Docker plugin visit their [help page](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Docker+Plugin)

This is an example of a builder Docker image for Maven (bear in mind that the Jenkins slave image installs Java8):

```
FROM jenkins/jnlp-slave

ARG user=jenkins

USER root

# install Maven

ARG MAVEN_VERSION=3.5.3
ARG USER_HOME_DIR="/root"
ARG SHA=b52956373fab1dd4277926507ab189fb797b3bc51a2a267a193c931fffad8408
ARG BASE_URL=https://apache.osuosl.org/maven/maven-3/${MAVEN_VERSION}/binaries

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y \
      curl procps \
  && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN mkdir -p /usr/share/maven /usr/share/maven/ref \
  && curl -fsSL -o /tmp/apache-maven.tar.gz ${BASE_URL}/apache-maven-${MAVEN_VERSION}-bin.tar.gz \
  && echo "${SHA}  /tmp/apache-maven.tar.gz" | sha256sum -c - \
  && tar -xzf /tmp/apache-maven.tar.gz -C /usr/share/maven --strip-components=1 \
  && rm -f /tmp/apache-maven.tar.gz \
  && ln -s /usr/share/maven/bin/mvn /usr/bin/mvn

ENV MAVEN_HOME /usr/share/maven
ENV MAVEN_CONFIG "$USER_HOME_DIR/.m2"

USER ${user}

ENV LC_ALL en_GB.UTF-8
CMD ["/bin/bash"]
```

Then, the last part is to create a new job that will use the Jenkinsfile of the repository.
From Jenkins, 'New item' -> 'Pipeline'. Then, the settings are as follows:

* Github project URL: [git-repo-url]
* Pipeline Definition: Pipeline script from SCM Pipeline
* SCM: Git
* Pipeline Repository URL: [git-repo-url]

## Decommissioning of the Jenkins

There are 4 steps to decommission the Jenkins platform for one of your environments:

* decommissioning the Jenkins infrastructure, via `terraform destroy`

* decommissioning the DNS infrastructure, via `terraform destroy`

* deleting the S3 buckets used for the Terraform state files

* deleting the Github OAuth app

### Before you start

1. Move to the directory in which you cloned the repository originally.\
If you don't have it anymore, clone the repository again and customise the `terraform.tfvars`
as you did during the provisioning steps, for both the `terraform\dns` and `terraform\jenkins` directories.

1. Make sure you still have this in `~/.aws/credentials`, otherwise add it again:

       ```
       [re-build-systems]
       aws_access_key_id = [your aws key here]
       aws_secret_access_key = [your aws secret here]
       ```

1. Export those credentials

   If you are using bash, then add a space at the start of export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY to prevent them from being added to ~/.bash_history.

   ```
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="[aws key]"
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="[aws secret]"
   export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="eu-west-1"
   ```

1. Export these environment variables

    ```
    export JENKINS_ENV_NAME=[environment-name]
    export JENKINS_TEAM_NAME=[team-name]
    ```

### Decommissioning the Jenkins infrastructure

1. Run this from the `terraform/jenkins` directory:

    ```
    terraform destroy \
        -var environment=$JENKINS_ENV_NAME \
        -var-file=./terraform.tfvars \
        -var ssh_public_key_file=~/.ssh/build_systems_${JENKINS_TEAM_NAME}_${JENKINS_ENV_NAME}_rsa.pub
    ```

    The previous `terraform destroy` command may fail to delete everything on the first run. If so, just run it again.

### Decommissioning the DNS infrastructure

1. Run this from the `terraform/dns` directory:

    ```
    terraform destroy -var-file=./terraform.tfvars
    ```

    The previous `terraform destroy` command may fail to delete everything on the first run. If so, just run it again.

### Deleting the Terraform state S3 buckets

1. Make sure you have `jq` (version `> 1.5.0`) installed

1. Run these commands from anywhere:

    ```
    aws s3api delete-objects \
      --bucket tfstate-dns-$JENKINS_TEAM_NAME.build.gds-reliability.engineering \
      --delete "$(aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket tfstate-dns-$JENKINS_TEAM_NAME.build.gds-reliability.engineering | jq '{Objects: [.Versions[] | {Key:.Key, VersionId : .VersionId}], Quiet: false}')"
    ```

    ```
    aws s3api delete-objects \
          --bucket tfstate-$JENKINS_TEAM_NAME-$JENKINS_ENV_NAME \
          --delete "$(aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket tfstate-$JENKINS_TEAM_NAME-$JENKINS_ENV_NAME | jq '{Objects: [.Versions[] | {Key:.Key, VersionId : .VersionId}], Quiet: false}')"
    ```

### Deleting the Github OAuth app

Go to [Github developer settings](https://github.com/settings/developers) > `OAuth Apps` > Select the app > `Delete application`
