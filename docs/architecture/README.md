# Architecture

## Architecture Decision Records

We record design decisions for the architecture to ensure we preserve the context of our
choices. These will be written in the format proposed in a
[blog post by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)

Please see the [decisions directory](decisions/) for a list of all ADRs.
