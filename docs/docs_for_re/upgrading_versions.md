# Upgrading third-party dependencies

## Purpose of this document

This document is for the maintainers of the [re-build-systems](https://github.com/alphagov/re-build-systems), [terraform-aws-re-build-dns](https://github.com/alphagov/terraform-aws-re-build-dns) and [terraform-aws-re-build-jenkins](https://github.com/alphagov/terraform-aws-re-build-jenkins) github repositories.

It covers how to upgrade versions of Terraform, Jenkins and Jenkins plugins on which the [re-build-systems Jenkins instance](https://github.com/alphagov/re-build-systems) is based.

This document does not cover upgrading of Linux Ubuntu versions, not does it cover upgrading the version of Docker.

## Important note

We should only be using lts (long term support) versions of software.

## Upgrading Terraform version

This is the version of Terraform you use to provision your Jenkins.

You can find the current version of Terraform in the `main.tf` files in each of the [terraform-aws-re-build-dns](https://github.com/alphagov/terraform-aws-re-build-dns) and [terraform-aws-re-build-jenkins](https://github.com/alphagov/terraform-aws-re-build-jenkins) modules.

If you need to upgrade the version, change the `required_version` entry in these `main.tf` files and test the change as described below.

## Upgrading Jenkins version

Currently, the Jenkins version is specified in the [terraform-aws-re-build-jenkins](https://github.com/alphagov/terraform-aws-re-build-jenkins) module.

To change the version of Jenkins, just change the `jenkins_version` in the https://github.com/alphagov/terraform-aws-re-build-jenkins/blob/master/versions.tf file.

## Testing upgraded version

If you have changed the versions of Terraform, Jenkins or Jenkins plugins then just commit your changes to a git branch. Once your changes have been committed, run through the examples in https://github.com/alphagov/re-build-systems/tree/master/examples and verify you can log into the Jenkins instance without any errors.
