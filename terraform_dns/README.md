# Reliability Engineering - Build Systems - Customer DNS and EIP Configuration

It will configure a customers subdomain and eip, which will allow them to remain persistent as they will be maintained within their own state file.


## Contributing

Refer to our [Contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Prerequisites

    * Install Terraform v0.11.7 (see https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html for guidance for your system)

    * Install Python3
      On a Mac, you can use
      `brew install awscli python3`

      On a Linux machine, you can use
      `apt-get install python3`

## Configuration

1. Configure your ~/.aws/credentials file with your own details:

    ```
    [re-build-systems]
    aws_access_key_id = AABBCCDDEEFFG
    aws_secret_access_key = abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890
    ```

2. Configure your DNS zone
		Edit terraform_dns/terraform.tfvars and change "team_name" and "top_level_domain_name", this will create a Route 53 zone called [team_name].[top_level_domain_name]

3. Configure your EIPs
		Edit terraform_dns/terraform.tfvars and change "team_environments".  For each environment specified an EIP will be created.


## Provision DNS Zone and EIP

1. Export secrets

    In order to initialise with Terraform the S3 bucket we have created, we need to export some secrets from the `~/.aws/credentials` file.

    ```
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AABBCCDDEEFFG"
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890"
    export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="eu-west-2"
    ```

    If you are using bash, then adding a space at the start of the `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` commands in the above prevents them from being added to `~/.bash_history`.

2. Run Terraform to create S3 bucket to hold state file

    ```
    export TEAM_NAME=[your team name with no whitespace characters]
    cd terraform_dns
    ./tools/create-dns-s3-state-bucket -d build.gds-reliability.engineering -p re-build-systems -t $TEAM_NAME
    terraform init -backend-config="region=$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION" -backend-config="bucket=tfstate-dns-$TEAM_NAME.build.gds-reliability.engineering" -backend-config="key=$TEAM_NAME.build.gds-reliability.engineering.tfstate"
    ```

3. Reprovision the DNS

    ```
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AABBCCDDEEFFG"
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890"
    export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="eu-west-2"
    ```

    If you are using bash, then adding a space at the start of the `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` commands in the above prevents them from being added to `~/.bash_history`, which is accessed by the `history` command.

2. Run Terraform

    ```
    export TEAM_NAME = [your team name]
    cd terraform_dns
    ./tools/create-dns-s3-state-bucket -d build.gds-reliability.engineering -p re-build-systems -t $TEAM_NAME
    terraform init -backend-config="region=$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION" -backend-config="bucket=tfstate-dns-$TEAM_NAME.build.gds-reliability.engineering" -backend-config="key=$TEAM_NAME.build.gds-reliability.engineering.tfstate"
    ```
